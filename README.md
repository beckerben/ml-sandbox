# ML Sandbox

## Description
This is a sandbox for some machine learning projects using python.  The files here may be incomplete, non-working and strictly experimental in nature.  These are used as part of another related hobby project using machine learning for some automating tasks using prediction capabilities offered by ML.

The python virtual environment is currently set to 3.11 and meant to work with NVIDIA GPUs.
